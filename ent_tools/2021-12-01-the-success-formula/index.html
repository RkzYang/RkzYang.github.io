<p><span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>: success level (the dependent variable): something you can keep in mind but is NOT under your control. It’s the outcome that “depends” on something else (on the right-hand side of the formula).</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>: the input (the independent variable): something you can control.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>: your method (the functional form): something that determines how your input converts into your outcome.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span>: noise (the error term): good luck and bad luck that are totally inevitable and completely out of your control. But it is very important so you should take notice and be mindful of it.</p>

<div id="setting-goal" class="section level3">
<h3>setting goal</h3>
<p><b> Set and Forget. </b> An entrepreneur should first model his/her <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> (success level). Set a goal on <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> but learn to shift focus to <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>. By making the shift, it is important to be emotionally detached from <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> when working on <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>. This is because if you are so emotionally fixated on <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, you will forget <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>. Then your formula will become merely “<span class="math inline">\(y = \epsilon\)</span>”, which means your outcome will totally depend on luck. In this case, you will learn nothing and control nothing.</p>
<p><b> Be Challenging, Specific, and Multi-level. </b> Setting a fixed, challenging goal (<span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>) helps you search for a better <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. The right way is to be fixed on your <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> but be flexible on your <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, because <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> (what you will achieve) depends on <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> (your method applied to your input), but not the other way around. Also, write down your goals at multiple levels. Don’t fall into the “security trap.” If you only have a “capped”, single-level goal for success, your learning and exploration for better <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> will slow down or even stop as soon as you hit your first-level goal.</p>

<div id="shifting-focus" class="section level3">
<h3>shifting focus</h3>
<p><b> Understand the “<span class="math inline">\(=\)</span>”: Goal is NOT Method. </b> <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> is the working process of how you use a given “method” <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> to transform your input <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, e.g., how you structure your schedule, how you organize your resources, how you utilize your skills, and, in the most general term, your “way of thinking.” When you understand this part, you will never mess up your goal <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> with your method <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and your input <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.</p>
<p><b> Avoid “Short-term” Traps. </b> Whenever you feel pressures from short-term <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> or are eager to receive instant gratifications from short-term <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, your should try to get your focus back on <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> is under your control “right here and right now,” <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> is not. You won’t be successful by focusing on success itself (<span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>). What you should do is to learn this simple trick: “do the right things; success will follow.” Pressures and temptations from short-term <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> can only take your productivity (your creativity and your concentration) from you. Moreover, the transformation process of <span class="math inline">\(y = f(x)\)</span> typically takes time to present itself. In the short term, you only tend to see <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span>.</p>
<p><b> Develop a Skill of Focus-shifting: </b></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>When tasking on <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, you should concentrate at “right here and right now” and throw <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> completely into the back of your mind.</li>
<li>When taking a break from <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, revisit your <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> and analyze <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> to improve your <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>.</li>
<li>When implementing on <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>, use schedules to develop routines for making plans and doing reflections, and let a well-paced, non-stopping process to carry you through.</li>

<h3>developing advantage</h3>
<p><b> Accept and Learn from the Noise. </b> The best part is that your outcome depends on how you deal with <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span>, be it flukes or failures. You need to do two things. First, remember that <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> is not the whole part of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. Otherwise, you will give up easily after encountering failures. The secret behind most success is that “winners never quit.” Second, learn from it. Understand that different people have different versions of the formula. Your <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> can also be other people’s <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span>. But if you can carve out a portion of <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> and put it into your <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>, which is a trick you figure out before others, or something you know but others don’t, you will have an unfair advantage. In this case, the <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> turns around to help you, by setting up a barrier to prevent others from stealing your success.</p>
<p><b> Convert the Noise. </b> How to do it? Analyze <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> carefully, and treat it as the “feedback” on your new <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> (method) and different combinations of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> (input), you will develop a refined <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> with private knowledge to create and sustain your advantage. Now, your <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> (method on input) is others’ “luck and miracles” <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span>. The most amazing thing is that only you know how to use a reliable system <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> to mass-produce “luck and miracles” in the eyes of others, and only you know there is no such things as “luck and miracles.”</p>
<p><b> Own your Errors </b> <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> has another nice name – error. Most successful people crack the code from trials and errors. Learning from feedback is key. The progress of learning is a function of the number of iterations <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. A greater number of iterations can generate more helpful data for us to learn from. But sometimes the feedback can be quite subtle. Without smoking-gun evidence on whether your method <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> will work, we have to rely on our own judgment, a leap of faith, or risk-taking. When you feel it’s too hard, it might be worth holding on to your old way <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, or it might be a good time to change your method <span class="math inline">\(f&#39;\)</span>. But never quit too soon, because the path to success is typically non-linear, so it is often critical to hold on until your hit the “critical mass” for any good methods <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> to work.</p>
